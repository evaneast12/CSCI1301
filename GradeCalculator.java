 *
 * Purpose: GradeCalculator.java asks the user for their grades
 * over the course of the semester in order to calculate a couple
 * of things. The program calculates what the user's final grade
 * in the class is if they know all of their grades. It can also
 * calculate what they will need on the rest of their assignments
 * in order to obtain a desired grade set by the user. If that 
 * grade is unattainable the program will tell the user that.
 *

 * received nor given inappropriate assistance. I have not copied
 * or modified code from any source other than the course webpage
 * or the course textbook. I recognize that any unauthorized
 * assistance or plagiarism will be handled in accordance with
 * the University of Georgia's Academic Honesty Policy and the
 * policies of this course. I recognize that my work is based
 * on an assignment created by the Department of Computer
